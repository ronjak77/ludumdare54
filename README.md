# ludumdare54

This is my entry to the Ludum Dare 54 game jam. It's my first time participating. I made this game in 48 hours by myself.

You can play the game in browser in the [Ludum Dare website](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/space-of-no-space) which also has more info. To participate in the Compo format, the source code of the project needs to be public. 


## About

Made with Godot 3.5. 

Overall, I'm happy with this. The balance is off and progression not very well thought out, and there's lots of bugs, but I made it in the time I had and with the skills I had. 
I started my first Godot project about two weeks ago. I previously have tried Unity but never made anything playable, so this was a great learning opportunity too. Next time, I'll try making some sounds & music too!
